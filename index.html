        <p>
            Meganeura, one of the largest Griffenflies common throught the Carboniferous and Permian.<br>
        </p>
    </a>
    <h2>Traits</h2>
    <p>
        These large areal preditores have advanced compound eyes designed to scan for potential victims.<br>
        They also have long grasping arms for grabing small animals and exoskelital teeth for disecting them quickly.<br>
        This all rolled into a body that can have a wingspan of 28 inches accross or over 2 feet.
    </p>
    <h2>Existence</h2>
    <p>
        First evolving around 300 million years ago,<br>
         the group spead across the northern hemisphere with fossils found in both Europe and North America.<br>
        These creatures would remain domiant for 70 milion years<br>
         before eventualy being out competed completly by the pterasaurs in the late Triassic.
        
    </p>
    <h2>Distinction</h2>
    <p>
        While highly resembling dragonflies, griffenflies are not all that related to other similar looking insects.<br>
        The main difference between them and dragonflies besides size is a changed wing venation system.
